### List different operations on sets?

### EQUIVALENT SETS

- Two sets A and B are said to be equivalent if their cardinal number is same, i.e.,n(A) = n(B).
- The symbol for denoting an equivalent set is‘↔’.

### OVERLAPPING SETS

Two sets A and B are said to be overlapping if
they contain at least one element in common.

### DISJOINT SETS

Two sets A and B are said to be disjoint, if theydo not have any element in common.

### EQUAL SETS

- Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they contain the same elements.
- Every element of A is an element of B and every element of B is an element of A.

### PROPER SUBSET

- If A and B are two sets, then A is called the proper subset of B if A ⊆ B but B ⊇ A i.e., A ≠ B. The symbol ‘⊂’ is used to denote proper subset. Symbolically, we write A ⊂ B.

### POWER SET

The collection of all subsets of set A is called the power set of A. It is denoted by P(A). In P(A), every element is a set.

#### Formula for power set

`n[P(A)] = 2^m`
<br>
where m is the number of elements in set A.

### OPERATIONS ON SETS

- UNION
- INTERSECTION
- DIFFERENCE
- COMPLEMENT
- SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE

**Difference** : The difference of two sets A and B is a set of all those elements which belong to A but do not belong to B and is denoted by A - B or A/B

**SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE** : The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set containing all the elements that are in A or in B but not in both and is denoted by AΘB.

```
i.e., A ⊕ B = (A ∪ B)\(A ∩ B) or
A ⊕ B = (A\B) ∪ (B\A)
Eg. A={1,2,3,4,5} B={4,5,6,7,8}
(A u B)= { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
(A n B)= {4,5}
A ⊕ B = (A u B) - (A n B) = { 1,2,3,6,7,8}
```

### INCLUSION–EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE

Suppose A and B are finite sets and they are not disjoint.
Then
```
n(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) − n(A ∩ B)
```
Also suppose A, B, C are finite sets.
Then
`A ∪ B ∪ C is finite`
and

```
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) − n(A ∩ B) −n(A ∩ C) − n(B ∩ C) + n(A ∩ B ∩ C)
```
